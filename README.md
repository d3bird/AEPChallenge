# AEPChallenge
 
Leverage Social Media to Celebrate Customer Loyalty/Anniversaries: 
Using anonymized customer data, teams will be asked to come up with example facebook/email messaging that we could use to proactively to communicate with the
'example' customers so as to celebrate their loyalty. E.g. HAPPY 1st Anniversary ? with an email that might show trends, comparisons, etc. A way to make a customer
feel 'good' about AEP. 

This is our solution to the AEP challenge.

The Bobcats++ team consists of two members, Scott Crawford and Austin Nutter, who both come from the Athens branch of Ohio University. Scott is a Sophomore 
Computer Science major and has attended five different Hackathons prior to Hack Ohi/O 2018. Austin is a Sophomore Computer Engineering major and has attended 
one prior Hackathon. Both were on the same team for their prior Hackathon and decided to come to Hack Ohi/O despite half of their team not being able to make it. 

At the start of Hackathon, Bobcats++ already had the AEP challenge in mind after hearing about it from the table outside the meeting room from talking to the 
industry representative. Both teammates quickly came up with a general outline of the overall algorithm with a main program to control everything with two 
separate programs designed solely to read the data from the spreadsheet and capable of sending automatic e-mails respectively. 

One of the biggest hurdles with the program was trying to get the C++ program to communicate with the Excel spreadsheet given by AEP. Both members tried out
multiple libraries and different strategies until it was decided to instead switch programming languages from C++ to Java which only one of the two team members were 
experienced with. After switching to Java, it was possible to make use of Apache POI to interpret Microsoft products, including Excel, to be able to read the data 
off the spreadsheet. 

Once you run the program you have the option of finding a finding a person, setting a email address, generating an email and sending it off to the address that was set and changing the data sheet for fresh data. The emails are generated based off of the data that we have the person, we show them possitive data from the previous billing periods to increase there satifaction with AEP.

Both members learned a good bit from working on this project. The inexperienced member really went in and got his feet wet trying out Java for the first time hands 
on with guidance from the experienced member. Meanwhile, the experienced member solidified his knowledge of using the Apache POI libraries and he learned how to 
send e-mails via Java. Both are proud of the work they were able to put into it and hope that it shows.
